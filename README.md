# TODO-List

Welcome to my simple TODO list!

I am currently learning JavaScript, and as part of this journey, I am writing a simple TODO list program. This version, at commit `b7a621e`, still needs a delete function. In future commits, I plan to add more features and functionality to make it more sophisticated.

I hope you enjoy it!
